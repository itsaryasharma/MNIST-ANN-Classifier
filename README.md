# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classifier — ANN (Scikit-learn)

This project is part of the **Infosys Springboard's module (Introduction to Deep Learning)** in the **AI & ML domain**.

It demonstrates how to build a basic **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**, using **Scikit-learn’s MLPClassifier**.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Loads digit images as pixel data (0–255 grayscale)
- Trains a neural network with **1 hidden layer (50 neurons)**
- Predicts digit classes (**0 to 9**)
- Evaluates model using **precision, recall, and F1-score**

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

- Clone or download this repo

- Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

- Make sure the following libraries are installed:

   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

- Run the notebook cell by cell to train and evaluate the ANN model.

## 📈 Output
- Achieved ~99% accuracy on the training data

- Learned the core concepts of neural networks, image preprocessing, and model evaluation

- A great first step before advancing to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
